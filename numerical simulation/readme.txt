- Six sets of 180 ° refocusing pulses: Six sets of different opposite phases were simulated, with +y_-y_+y_-y and -y_+y_-y_+y yielding relatively worse results, for reasons that may remain to be explored.

-meanquantification.m: Simulation results of four T1rho preparation modules under specific conditions (Figure 4)
-heatmap.m: This is used to simulate the compensation performance of four SL modules under different B0 and B1 field defects (Figure 5)
-ratios.m: Repeated simulations were conducted at various fSL points (100–4,000 Hz), and across different T1ρ: T2ρ ratios (1: 5–5: 1) (Figure 6)
-numerical calculation.nb: Calculate the Mz of four modules under specific circumstances (Eqs. 18-25)
